Made this because I though "what would be easy?" and was terribly mistaken! At least I've learned a LOT about EasyEDA and working with PCBs! Also, I have an uncomfortable amount of knowledge about USB-C ports now... eugh.

## Project Overview

### Features

This things got two cutting-edge (I'm joking, this is all USB 2.0) USB-A ports and two USB-C ports. There's also a dashing little dragon on the top along with my usual username!

### Included Files (what's in /PCB/)

I put both available BOM options in since I wasn't sure which would be preferred.
* BOM.xlsx
* BOM.csv
* Gerber.zip
* PickAndPlace.xlsx
